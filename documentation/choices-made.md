## Prescribed by dev-toolkit
- universal usage

## Prescribed by template starting points
- src/client - all client-related files
- src/server - all server-related files
- src/settings.js - relevant application-wide settings

## Philosophy
- aim is to be very flexible and customizeable
- allow for many different usages within a company
- pre-rendering is first-class citizen
- rendering of dynamic-pages splittable
- only necessary configuration
- small api-surface
- tested
- css-in-js without removing boilerplate

## The future
- make it easy to use your own boilerplate
- create typescript template
- template with react-router
- template with redux
